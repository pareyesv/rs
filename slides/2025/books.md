## The War of Art {.fl-r .full-v .shadow}

"There’s a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don’t, and the secret is this:

It’s not the writing part that’s hard.

What’s hard is sitting down to write.

What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance.

## Do the work {.fl-r .full-v .shadow}

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Do_the_work.jpg)

Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled.

But it can be felt.

We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential.

It’s a repelling force. It’s negative.

Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.

## Resistance

The following is a list, in no particular order, of activities that often trigger Resistance:

1. The pursuit of any calling in writing, painting, music, film, dance, or any creative art, however marginal or unconventional.

2. The launching of any entrepreneurial venture or enterprise, for profit or otherwise.

3. Any diet or health regimen.

6. Any course or program designed to overcome an unwholesome habit or addiction.

In other words, any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Or, expressed another way, any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Any of these will elicit Resistance.

## Resistance marks the way {.center .black background="var(--color-yellow)"}

Use it as a compass
