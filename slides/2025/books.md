## The War of Art {.fl-r .full-v .shadow}

"There’s a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don’t, and the secret is this:

It’s not the writing part that’s hard.

What’s hard is sitting down to write.

What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance.

## Resistance

"Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled.

"But it can be felt.

"We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential.

"It’s a repelling force. It’s negative.

"Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work."

## Things that trigger Resistance

"The following is a list, in no particular order, of activities that often trigger Resistance:

## 1. The pursuit of any calling in writing, painting, music, film, dance, or any creative art, however marginal or unconventional

## 2. The launching of any entrepreneurial venture or enterprise, for profit or otherwise

## 3. Any diet or health regimen

## 6. Any course or program designed to overcome an unwholesome habit or addiction

## In other words

any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity.

any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower.

Any of these will elicit Resistance.

## Resistance marks the way {.center .black background="var(--color-yellow)"}

Use it as a compass
