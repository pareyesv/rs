# Structured Documents {.center .good}

## Structured documents

You probably know that using a good _data structure_ can dramatically improve an algorithm

And you use _structured programs_

The same applies to structuring our documents

Maybe you have used LaTeX, or Markdown

Maybe you know HTML

## Separation of concerns

The key idea is to describe _what things are_, not _how they look_

Describe the role of text, not the "looks"

Separate style from structure

::: source
This part is based on the ideas discussed in "LaTeX: A Document Preparation System" by Leslie Lamport (1986).

## It is like a house {.large}

Structure makes the house solid and comfortable

If you only do decoration, the house looks nice but it is not solid

Structure of the walls come first

Painting the walls in a nice color is secondary

## Structural elements

+ Sections, subsections, paragraphs
+ Figures and Tables
+ Lists
+ References
+ Equations
+ Metadata
  + Title
  + Authors
  + Affiliations
  + Dates: submission, acceptance
  + Media/format

# Final comments {.center .good}

## Take care of yourself

+ Drink a lot of water
  + Especially when you drink alcohol
+ Get enough sleep
  + Don't fry your brain, you only have one
+ Try to make a routine. Minimize trivial decisions
  + Save your energy for important things
+ Go for a walk every day

## Become a writer

+ Write every day. No exceptions.
  + Start with 150 or 200 daily words
  + Ideal is 750 daily words

+ Once you see yourself as "someone who writes every day", it will be easy to write papers, projects, thesis, etc.

+ Get addicted to write, as you are addicted to social media

+ Try the _Pomodoro technique_

# Thank you! {.center .good}
